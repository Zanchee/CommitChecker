# âœ… CommitChecker

**CommitChecker** is a swift command line script that analyzes your application's commit history and a JIRA fix version to validate that all work for a fix version has been completed, and that no additional untracked work was completed.

After running the script, **CommitChecker** outputs a report that checks the following...
- All Commits without associated issues.
- Commits that contain issues not associated with the specified fix version.
- Issues for a JIRA fix version that are not resolved.
- Issues for a JIRA fix version that don't have any associated commits.

## Reporting
Reports can either be printed to the console or output to a file. They come two formats...
- TEXT Outputs a plain text report. Useful for continous integration builds.
- HTML Outputs a styled html report similar to Github's markdown. Useful for sharing and reporting.

## Configuration
**CommitChecker** looks for a configuration file called `commit_checker.json` in the current directory and uses it to configure both required and optional parameters.
